## About Me

Hi! I'm now a PhD student advised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/danfeng-hong">Danfeng Hong</a> at the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

Prior to CAS, I obtained my B. Eng. degree in Information Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). During my undergraduate study life, I focused on High-Dimensional Data Analysis and Face Recognition.


## Research Interests
Currently, I am interested in Multimodal Remote Sensing and Large Foundation Models.

Looking for strong graduate/undergraduate students to collaborate. Please reach out if you are interested.

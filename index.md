## About Me

Hi! I'm now a PhD student advised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/danfeng-hong">Danfeng Hong</a> at Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

Currently, I am interested in Remote Sensing Foundation Models.

Prior to CAS, I obtained my B. Eng. major in Information Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). During my post-graduate study life, I focused on High-Dimensional Data Analysis and Face Recognition.
